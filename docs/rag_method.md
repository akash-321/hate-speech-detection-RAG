### RAG Method (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

1. Collect background information from Wikipedia.  
2. When the model reads a comment, it also looks at related background text.  
3. The model uses both pieces of text to decide if it is hate speech or not.  
4. Compare this version with the normal model to see if it performs more fairly.
