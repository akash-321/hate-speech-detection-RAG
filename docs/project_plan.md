### Project Plan

This project will train a hate speech detection model on the UC Berkeley dataset and compare it with the IMSyPP model.  
The main goal is to test if adding background information through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) helps the model understand cultural context and reduce bias, especially around religion.
