# Investigation of Hate Speech Detection Model through religious lens

This repository contains my master's dissertation project under Prof. Simona Frenda.  
The goal is to build a **Retrieval-Augmented, perspective-aware NLP model** for hate speech detection using the **UC Berkeley Measuring Hate Speech dataset**.

## Objectives
- Analyse perspectivist annotations (multiple annotators, metadata).
- Train baseline Transformer (BERT/XLM-R).
- Develop Retrieval-Augmented model integrating cultural/contextual information.
- Evaluate fairness, perspective alignment, and bias.

## Current Status
- [x] Repository setup  
- [x] Environment configuration
- [x] Exploration of dataset
- [ ] Training, validation and test set creation (wednesday 11th feb)
- [ ] Model training (12th feb - 18th feb)
- [ ] Model Validation and testing (19th feb - 20th feb)
- [ ] IMSyPP prediction (21th feb - 25th feb)
- [ ] Quantitative analysis (26th feb - 4th March)
- [ ] Qualitative analysis (fairness/bias)  (5th March - 13th March)
- [ ] RAG integration
