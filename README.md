# Investigation of Hate Speech Detection Model through religious lens

This repository contains my master's dissertation project under Prof. Simona Frenda.  
The goal is to build a **Retrieval-Augmented, perspective-aware NLP model** for hate speech detection using the **UC Berkeley Measuring Hate Speech dataset**.

## Objectives
- Analyse perspectivist annotations (multiple annotators, metadata).
- Train baseline Transformer (BERT/XLM-R).
- Develop Retrieval-Augmented model integrating cultural/contextual information.
- Evaluate fairness, perspective alignment, and bias.

## Current Status
- [x] Repository setup  
- [x] Environment configuration
- [ ] Exploration of dataset
- [ ] Training, validation and test set creation
- [ ] Model fine-tuning
- [ ] IMSyPP prediction
- [ ] Quantitative analysis
- [ ] Qualitative analysis (fairness/bias)  
- [ ] RAG integration
